- consider collapsing src/dst8 into loc8, ditto loc16
  - have unary/binary embeddable instruction bases
    - encode helper can examine loc for IX etc
      - also need to encode displacement!

- panic on write to imm8

- assembler needs Encode() on Instruction
  - drive via same all tests
  - or as part of decode test loop?
    buf -> inst         ; decode
    inst -> string      ; disass
    string -> inst      ; ass
    inst -> buf         ; encode

- add cmdline disassembler
  - try on some big files
  - add (made up) labels for jump targets in disassembler

DONE - implement ED

- implement DDCB+FDCB

DONE - grab speccy book table for decode test
