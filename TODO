DONE - add Read/Write16 (want it to read (PC))

DONE - Add a Run loop
  - single byte instructions initially
  - fetch, then execute instrucion
  - gah. ok, look at the loc8 bit patterns for other instructions and work out categories
  (LD src, dest has different bit patterns for src and dest, work out how many funcs we need for 3bits => reg)

- Add a LD8 instruction which copies a single byte
  DONE - register to register
  - and immediate constant

- Add a RST16 hack which debug-prints contents of A?
  - need a way to run until test

- write a program which stores 0x16 to A then prints it


- add INC8 and DEC8

- add (HL) address mode to R8Loc

- add LD16, INC16, DEC16

- add DJNZ
